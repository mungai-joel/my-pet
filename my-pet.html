    <h1>Hello darkness, my old pet</h1>
    <h2>i've come to blog about you again</h2>
    <p>Because a vision softly creeping
      Left its seeds while I was sleeping
      And the vision that was planted in my brain
      Still remains
      Within the sound of silence</p>
      <p>And in the naked light I saw</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ten thousand people, maybe more</li>
      <li>People talking without speaking</li>
      <li>People hearing without listening</li>
      <li>People writing songs that voices never share</li>
      <li>And no one dare</li>
      <li>Disturb the sound of silence</li>
    </ul>
